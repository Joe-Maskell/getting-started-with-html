  <title>CodePen - A Pen by  Joe Maskell</title>

</head>

<body>

  <p>From the first lesson, I have learned the various components of the internet and I've begun the journey of understanding how to write my own web page (of which this is a basic example).</p>
I've learned about <em>formatting text</em>, adding <a href = udacity.com>links</a>, embedding videos and pictures and how to produce a webpage using scratchpad and save it to a file on my computer using CodePen.
I've learned of two types of HTML tags, <br>in-line and <p>'box'</p> tags (I can't remember the official name for these tags). <br>Oh! And I've learned that it's OK not to remember everything because there is such a lot to learn and we can always look the information up on the internet.
